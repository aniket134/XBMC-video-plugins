Client machine has the following software: Nihao, apache, python.
It has to have access to a CD/DVD writer.

Nihao on a client machine allows content producers to do P-http. That is, Nihao
allows a client to interact with a web-browser, although most of that
interaction is programmed by the content producer (such as the repository).  A
content producer provides two python scripts to Nihao on client machine:
index.py and MakeMessage.py.  Nihao at client calls index.py at the beginning,
and MakeMessage.py at the end just before producing an outgoing CD.

The Nihao code is in Nihao/cgi-bin/Nihao/ and Nihao/WWW/Nihao/ directories.

Think of Nihao as implementing P-http.

---------------

Repository machine has the following software: PDRROOT, apache, python, Primera
robot installation, and it has the robot attached to it.

Primera robot installation makes a directory: C:\JOBS\. The robot takes job
requests from this directory.

PDRROOT is the directory of the repository. PDR stands for Postmanet Data
Repository.

Repository management code is in PDRROOT/bin/, PDRROOT/cgi-bin/ and
PDRROOT/WWW/

Repository-supplied Nihao code is in PDRROOT/pythonscriptsforclient/

The objects served by the repository are in PDRROOT/DATA

PDRROOT/Endpoints.pk is a python datastructure containing mailing addresses for
all the users. The bin directory has scripts to do stuff to this file.

PDRROOT/Passwords is the password file for all legitimate users in the system.
Currently it has these users: rywang, garg, sobti, lai. Password is same as
lastname.

PDRROOT/QUEUES/ contains the download request queues for each of the users.

PDRROOT/TMP/ is for temporary CD/DVD images used when reading in or writing out
CDs/DVDs.

---------------

The code is not very well structured. Most code assumes that PDRROOT is
'C:\PDRROOT\' and similar other things. :)
