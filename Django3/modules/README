This folder contains python modules to be used by this plugin.

The only thing to be kept in mind is that the module placed
in this directory is not already present in python2.4.5.
If this happens than the module in theis directory will not
be loaded and python2.4.5 module will be loaded.
To avoid this, you can rename your module and then import
it. Of course the thing to be kept in mind is that that
module should only refer to modules inside this folder or
inside python2.4.5.
